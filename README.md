# Performance-Analysis-of-Microservices-Based-Architectures-Using-Parallel-Processing-Benchmarks
Microsystems architecture is used to make parallel processing applications more robust and easier to develop. The aim of the project is to compare the performance of commonly accepted parallel processing benchmarks, implemented either as traditional multithread applications or using multiple worker microservices.
